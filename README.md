# Color-Memory-Game
A fun and interactive JavaScript project built with HTML, CSS, and JS. The game briefly shows a color, hides it, and then challenges the player to guess it from four options. With a score system and increasing difficulty, itâ€™s a great way to sharpen your color recognition and memory skills!
